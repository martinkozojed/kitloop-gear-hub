  "faqTitle": "FAQ",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "Does it support online reservations for customers?",
      "a": "No. The MVP is provider-only — customers don't self-book yet, reservations are created by staff. After the pilot we're considering a \"Request Link\" so customers can submit a request."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does manual approval mean?",
      "a": "We manage onboarding capacity and want to know the operation we're working with. It's not bureaucracy — it's our guarantee that every launch goes well."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I get my Excel data into the system?",
      "a": "Kitloop supports CSV import for inventory. We'll help you with the conversion during onboarding."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does it take to get started?",
      "a": "Depends on the size of your inventory. We'll guide you through it step by step — importing data, reviewing the workflow, and making sure your team is ready."
    },
    {
      "q": "Payments and deposits?",
      "a": "Deposit tracking and notes are part of the handover flow. Payment transactions (online payments, refunds) are not part of the core MVP flow."
