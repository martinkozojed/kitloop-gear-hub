      "paragraph1": "Kitloop started as a fictional business for a university marketing course. But instead of creating something random, I looked at a real problem: at home, we had tons of outdoor gear that we used only once or twice a year. Meanwhile, people kept buying new things.",
      "paragraph2": "That's how the idea was born — a platform where rental providers and individuals could offer their gear online, all in one place.",
      "paragraph3": "We believe the gear rental market urgently needs digitalization — and this is our answer."
