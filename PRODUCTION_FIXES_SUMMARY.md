# 🚨 Production Hotfix Summary - January 12, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Profile Query Timeout (>10s)
**Symptom**: Every page load/refresh took >10 seconds, making the app unusable
**Root Cause**: Missing index on `profiles.user_id` + timeout too aggressive
**Fix**:
- ✅ Added `idx_profiles_user_id` index for O(1) lookups
- ✅ Increased timeout from 10s → 30s (temporary, until indexes apply)
- ✅ Verified RLS policy is optimal (`auth.uid() = user_id`)

### Issue #2: Reservations 400 Error
**Symptom**: `/provider/reservations` page showed no data, 400 error in console
**Root Cause**: RLS policy mismatch - code queries by `provider_id`, policy used `gear_id IN (SELECT...)`
**Fix**:
- ✅ Added direct RLS policy: `provider_id IN (SELECT id FROM providers WHERE user_id = auth.uid())`
- ✅ Added missing policies: INSERT and UPDATE for providers
- ✅ Added performance indexes: `idx_reservations_provider_id`, `idx_reservations_gear_id`
- ✅ Added composite index: `idx_reservations_provider_status_dates` for filtered queries

### Issue #3: Duplicate Profile Fetches (Race Condition)
**Symptom**: `fetchUserProfile()` called 2-3 times on page load, causing perceived slowness
**Root Cause**: `onAuthStateChange` listener registered **before** `initializeAuth()` completed → caught `INITIAL_SESSION` event → duplicate fetch
**Fix**:
- ✅ Refactored `useEffect` to use IIFE: `await initializeAuth()` → `then setupAuthListener()`
- ✅ Listener now skips `INITIAL_SESSION` event entirely
- ✅ Deduplication guards: `lastProcessedUserId` + `isProcessing` flag
- ✅ Proper cleanup of subscription

## 📂 Files Changed

### 1. **New Migration File**
`supabase/migrations/20250112_hotfix_production_issues.sql`
- Added 5 indexes for performance
- Fixed reservations RLS policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Verified profiles RLS policy
- Added `ANALYZE` commands to update query planner stats
- Includes diagnostic queries for verification

### 2. **AuthContext.tsx** (Refactored)
`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Line 63-66**: Increased profile fetch timeout to 30s
- **Line 92-97**: Increased provider fetch timeout to 30s
- **Line 130-273**: Complete `useEffect` refactor with:
  - Separate `initializeAuth()` function
  - Separate `setupAuthListener()` function
  - IIFE to ensure correct execution order
  - Skip `INITIAL_SESSION` event
  - Improved deduplication logic
  - Better logging with timestamps

### 3. **No Changes Needed**
`src/pages/provider/ProviderReservations.tsx` - Already correct, issue was in RLS

## 🔧 Database Migration Instructions

**CRITICAL**: Run this migration in production Supabase ASAP!

### Option 1: Supabase CLI
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Copy entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250112_hotfix_production_issues.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. Verify success (should say "Success. No rows returned")

### Option 3: Manual SQL
```sql
-- Run these essential queries manually:

-- 1. Add critical index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id ON public.profiles(user_id);

-- 2. Fix reservations RLS
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Providers can view their gear reservations" ON public.reservations;
CREATE POLICY "Providers can view own reservations by provider_id"
  ON public.reservations FOR SELECT
  USING (
    provider_id IN (SELECT id FROM public.providers WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
  );

-- 3. Update stats
ANALYZE public.profiles;
ANALYZE public.reservations;
```

## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Profile query time | >10s (timeout) | <1s ⚡ |
| Reservations load | 400 error ❌ | 200 OK ✅ |
| Duplicate fetches | 2-3x | 1x ✅ |
| Page load UX | Unusable 🔴 | Fast 🟢 |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (After Code Deploy)
- [ ] `npm run dev` → app starts without errors
- [ ] Login → profile loads <5s
- [ ] Console shows: `⏭️ Skipping INITIAL_SESSION`
- [ ] NO duplicate `fetchUserProfile START` logs
- [ ] `/provider/dashboard` loads instantly
- [ ] `/provider/reservations` loads without 400 error

### Production Testing (After DB Migration + Deploy)
- [ ] Login to https://kitloop.cz
- [ ] Profile loads in <5s (check Network tab)
- [ ] Navigate to `/provider/reservations`
- [ ] Reservations list loads (not 400)
- [ ] Filter by status → works
- [ ] Search by customer → works
- [ ] Create new reservation → works
- [ ] Logout → re-login → no issues

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Open DevTools → Network tab
- [ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check `profiles` query: <1s ✅
- [ ] Check `reservations` query: <500ms ✅
- [ ] NO duplicate queries ✅

### Tab Switch Test (Safari Freeze Fix)
- [ ] Login → dashboard loads
- [ ] Switch to another tab (Claude/Supabase)
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] Return to dashboard tab
- [ ] Should appear **instantly** (no freeze)
- [ ] Console shows: `TOKEN_REFRESHED (no action needed)`

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Work

### Temporary Workarounds
- **Timeout 30s**: Still too high, but necessary until indexes fully apply. Monitor and reduce to 5s after a week.
- **No retry logic**: If profile fetch fails, user must refresh. Consider adding retry with exponential backoff.

### Future Optimizations
1. **Add Redis cache** for profiles/providers (reduce DB hits)
2. **Implement React Query** for better caching + stale-while-revalidate
3. **Add service worker** for offline support
4. **Lazy load** provider data (fetch only when needed, not on every auth check)
5. **Connection pooling** - Supabase may benefit from pgBouncer

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Set up Sentry for timeout errors
- Add custom logging for slow queries (>2s)
- Track `fetchUserProfile` duration in analytics
- Alert if timeout rate >5%

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Deploy Database Migration** (Do First!)
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Paste contents of supabase/migrations/20250112_hotfix_production_issues.sql
# Click RUN
```

### 2. **Deploy Code Changes**
```bash
# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "🚨 HOTFIX: Profile timeout + Reservations 400 + Deduplication race"

# Deploy to production
# (Your deployment method - Vercel/Netlify/etc)
```

### 3. **Verify in Production**
- Visit https://kitloop.cz
- Login as test provider
- Check console for clean auth flow
- Test reservations page
- Monitor for errors

---

## 📞 Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Rollback Code
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

### Rollback Database (Unlikely Needed)
```sql
-- Only if absolutely necessary
-- The migration is additive (only adds indexes + policies)
-- Rollback would be:
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_reservations_provider_id;
-- But this will make things slower, not break them
```

## 📝 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

1. **Missing Indexes**:
   - Initial migration didn't include indexes
   - As data grew, queries became O(n) instead of O(1)
   - RLS policies scan entire table without indexes

2. **RLS Policy Mismatch**:
   - Migration used `gear_id` for reservations policy
   - Frontend code queries by `provider_id`
   - Mismatch caused 400 error (forbidden by RLS)

3. **Race Condition in Auth**:
   - Listener registered synchronously (no `await`)
   - Caught `INITIAL_SESSION` before `initializeAuth` completed
   - Caused duplicate profile fetches

### Lessons Learned

- ✅ Always add indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ Always add indexes on RLS policy columns
- ✅ Match RLS policies to actual query patterns
- ✅ Test auth flow with React DevTools Profiler
- ✅ Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify query performance
- ✅ Run `ANALYZE` after schema changes
