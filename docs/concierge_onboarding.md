## Checklist

### 1. Open the invite link
- Click the link sent to you.
- It opens the Kitloop app in your browser.

### 2. Sign up / log in
- **New user**: enter your email and choose a password → click **Sign Up**.
- **Existing user**: click **Log in** and enter your credentials.
- Check your inbox for a confirmation email; click the link inside.

### 3. Complete the setup wizard — Workspace

### 5. Complete the setup wizard — Inventory choice

  - **Demo Data** → skip for now, explore with sample data.
- Click **Finish** (or the relevant action button).

### 6. Wait for admin approval
- Your account is in **pending** status after setup.

- Status should be **Available**.
- Repeat for each physical unit you own.

### 9. Create a reservation
- Go to **Reservations** → **New Reservation**.
- Select product/variant, pick dates, enter customer name.
- Confirm → status becomes **Confirmed**.

### 10. Issue the gear
- Open the reservation detail.
- Click **Issue to Customer**.
- If prompted for payment override (cash payment), enter reason (e.g., "Cash on site") and confirm.
- Status becomes **Active**; asset moves to **Customer**.

### 11. Print the reservation slip
- In the reservation detail, click **Print** (or the print icon).
- Use browser print dialog — save as PDF or print directly.

### 12. Process a return
- When the customer returns gear, open the reservation.
- Click **Accept Return**.
- If gear is undamaged: confirm as-is → asset returns to **Available**.
- If gear is damaged: check **Damaged**, add a note (and photo if available) → asset moves to **Maintenance**.
- Status becomes **Completed**.
